                <p>Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get
                    outside every single day. If he isn't causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and
                    sleeping.
                </p>
                <p>Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie
                    chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six
                    years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.

                <p>Luna is a very jealous, loving, and protective dog. She really embraces her inner chihuahua and will bark at any
                    stranger, car, or noise at night. She makes the perfect guard dog. But she is not at all aggressive. Luna is all

                    Jax is a kitten, about five months old that I found this summer at a gas station while traveling to Marquette, Michigan.
                    He was scared and malnourished, crying in the parking lot. I took him with me and after some healthy meals and a trip to
                    the vet he is doing great!
                </p>
                <p>
                    My roommates and I just recently moved and Jax has been having a hard time getting used to the large house since we were
                    previously living in a small apartment. Jax is incredibly playful and loves to run around, but when he is sleepy he is
                    happy to be held.

                <p>
                    Guinea pigs are a naturally energetic animal, who spend up to 20 hours a day awake. Despite being awake for long periods
                    of time, they naturally hide in their habitats, and can be difficult to see in their inclosures. Guinea pigs naturally
                    are social creatures that enjoy socializing with other guinea pigs, in the wild they form packs of five to ten.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Leo is a half-lazy, half-lively guinea pig that either likes to run around on the floor, doing tiny hops, or likes to
                    lay down in the cage for hours at a time nibbling at hay. His favorite hobby is eating, and he can tell whenever someone
                    is about to give good to him by waiting at the end of the cardboard box patio he has attached to his cage.
